You can do the following things with the .ajax() method:

1. Call any Action method of the Controller.
2. Pass values to Action parameters from the View.
3. Get the response from the Action method and show it on the View.
4. All these things happen with no page postback.

$.ajax({
            type: "POST",
            url: "/Home/Add",
            data: {number1: val1, number2: val2},
            dataType: "text",
            success: function (msg) {
                console.log(msg);
            },
            error: function (req, status, error) {
                console.log(msg);
            }
        }); 

1. type as POST – it means jQuery will make HTTP POST type of request to the ‘Add’ Action.
2. url as "/Home/Add" – it should be URL to which the Action method can be invoked.
3. data as {number1: val1, number2: val2} – here I give the values to the Action method’s parameters which are        number1 and number2. The values should be specified in key-value manner like:
	a. number1: val1
	b. number2: val2
4. dataType as text – it specifies the type of response the ‘Add’ action from controller will send back. This Action method sends the       response in ‘int’ so I used ‘text’.
5. success() – it is the callback function that executes if the .ajax() method executes successfully.
6. error() – it is another callback function that executes if there is some failure when executing the .ajax()    method.
